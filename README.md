## ❗ Problem Identification  
Traditional shopping is inefficient due to:  
- Long queues at billing counters  
- Manual scanning of items  
- Difficulty in budget management  
- Challenges for elderly, pregnant women, and differently-abled shoppers  

**Proposed Solution:** Smart Shopping Cart with **automatic billing, RFID scanning, obstacle detection, and mobile app integration**.

## 💡 Design Thinking Approach  
We followed a **5-step design thinking process**:  
1. **Empathize** – Understanding users’ needs  
2. **Define** – Clear problem statement  
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorming multiple solutions  
4. **Prototype** – Building low-cost functional models  
5. **Test** – Refining with user feedback
